# Senior Vue.js Developer Recruitment Test - UI/UX Focus

## Task Overview

You are tasked with building a user interface that interacts with the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to display detailed information about movies based on their [IMDb ID](https://www.imdb.com/). Your solution should emphasize a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly design.

## Objectives

- **Input Field for IMDb IDs**: Implement an input field where users can enter multiple IMDb IDs, separated by commas. The interface should fetch and display information for each movie (e.g., title, poster, plot, director, actors).

- **Title-Based Search**: Include an additional search input that allows users to filter displayed movies by their title (using a substring match). The results should update dynamically as the user types.

- **Movie Detail View**: Enable users to click on any movie from the list to view more detailed information about that specific movie.

- **Favorite Movies**: Allow users to favorite a movie by clicking on its poster or a star icon. Although no server-side implementation is needed, ensure that the UI reflects the favorited status. Include a filter option to show only favorited movies.

- **UI/UX Quality**: Focus on delivering a clean, visually appealing, and highly usable interface. Creativity and attention to detail in the user experience are key.

- **State Persistence**: There’s no need to persist data beyond the session. The app should start with a blank state upon refresh.

## Requirements

- **Technology Stack**:

  - **Vue.js**: Use Vue.js version 3 for this task.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: Apply Tailwind for styling the interface.

- **Repository**:
  - Create a GitHub repository for your project and provide the link.
  - Ensure the repository includes clear instructions in the README for running the project.

## Time Allocation

The task is designed to be completed in approximately 2 hours.

**Note**: You will need an API key to access OMDb API endpoints, which can be obtained from the [OMDb website](http://www.omdbapi.com/).
